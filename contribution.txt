In OWASP Threat Dragon, Spoofing is a key threat category from the STRIDE model, representing an attacker impersonating a legitimate user, service, or system (like faking an email sender or stealing a token) to gain unauthorized access or privileges, often seen with Actors in diagrams; you add a "Spoofing" threat to a model element (like a Website Dev component), turning the element red, to identify risks like phishing or fake credentials, and then detail its description, severity, and potential mitigations.

How Spoofing Works in Threat Dragon:
STRIDE Framework: Spoofing (masquerading as someone else) is one of the six STRIDE categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
Element Association: Spoofing threats are common for "Actor" elements (users/attackers) but can be added to others.
Adding the Threat: In your threat model diagram, select a component, click "New Threat," choose "Spoofing," and describe how an attacker might impersonate a user or service (e.g., stealing session tokens, fake login pages).
Visual Indicator: The component's outline turns red to show it has identified threats.
Risk Assessment: You then assess the risk by setting status (e.g., "Open"), severity, and planning mitigations (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

Examples of Spoofing Threats:
Email Spoofing: Fake sender addresses in phishing emails to trick users.
IP Spoofing: Hiding true IP to appear as a trusted source on a network.
Authentication Spoofing: Attacker steals a user's token to impersonate them. 
Threat Dragon helps you systematically find and manage these threats within your system's design.
